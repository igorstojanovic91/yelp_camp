    It is positioned automatically to the starting point (top-left corner) of its parent element. 
    If it doesnâ€™t have any parent elements, then the initial document <html> will be its parent.
    Since position: absolute removes the element from the document flow, other elements are affected 
    and behave as the element is removed completely from the webpage.
    Like position: absolute, fixed positioned elements are also removed from the normal document flow. The differences are:
    They are only relative to the <html> document, not any other parents.
    They are not affected by scrolling.*/
